        <p>Iâ€™m a front end developer (with design experience) who lives and breathes JavaScript,
            HTML and CSS. I create beautiful, simple and effective designs for web and mobile
            applications from conception to production.
            I work closely with back end developers, designers, copywriters, and product owners to
            create elegant user experiences; I thrive on feedback, critique and iteration.</p>
