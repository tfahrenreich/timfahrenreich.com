        <p>Glitterrings recently went through a re-branding and approached me to put together their B2B website</p>
        <p>The main objective was to display what their capabilities are, concisely elegantly. Secondly, they wanted the website to be able to generate leads for new business.</p>
        <p>Working closely with their creative director, we were able to get the site out in under a month, generating 11,000 unique visits in the first year.</p>
