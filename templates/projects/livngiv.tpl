        <p>LivnGiv was a start-up that partnered with local restaurants to sell gift cards that automatically donated to a cause of the purchasers choice. Users redeemed certificates on the mobile web app.
            When I joined LivnGiv in 2013 I was tasked with aiding the creative team in transitioning from GiviGiv (old platform), as well as a new interface for our partners and customers emphasising the ease of purchase and redemption.</p>
