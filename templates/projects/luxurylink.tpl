        <p>Luxury Link is an OTA that curates luxury travel experiences.</p>
        <p>During my time time at LL our main objective was to modernize our website, which was mostly unchanged since the early 2000s.
            Our main concerns migrating to a responsive framework and cleaning up our dated codebase.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refactoring and centralizing the legacy codebase into legible and reusable modules that are useful to other/future
                members of the team.</li>
            <li>Created a responsive framework to function alongside the legacy framework to allow for a graceful transition to a fully
                responsive purchasing funnel.</li>
            <li>Worked closely with creative team to flesh out UI and UX while keeping any overly ambitious projects within the
                realms our of capabilities and projects time constraints.</li>
            <li>Set standards for our browser compatibility for mobile and desktop browsers.</li>
            <li>Implemented multiple 3rd party tags to increase analytics and improve overall conversion rates.</li>
            <li>Optimized CDN.</li>
